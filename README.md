🔁 Recursive Digit Finder in C

A clean and efficient implementation of recursive logic in C to find the minimum and maximum digits within a number.
This project demonstrates how recursion can simplify iterative logic into elegant, self-referential functions.

📜 Overview

Recursion is a fundamental concept in programming where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem.
In these programs, recursion is used to:

Break a number into its individual digits

Compare them recursively

Return the minimum or maximum digit found

🧩 Features

✅ Written purely in C
✅ Demonstrates clear base case and recursive case design
✅ Uses only integer arithmetic (no arrays or loops)
✅ Clean, readable, and beginner-friendly code
✅ Ideal for practicing recursion and digit manipulation
🧠 Key Learning Takeaways
